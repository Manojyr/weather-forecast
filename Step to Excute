What the App Does
The homepage (home.html) includes a form where the user can enter a city name.

On form submission, the views.py file likely:

Reads the city name from the form,

Uses the API key from key.py to call a weather service (e.g., OpenWeatherMap),

Retrieves weather data (temperature, humidity, description, etc.),

Then displays the data on results.html.
